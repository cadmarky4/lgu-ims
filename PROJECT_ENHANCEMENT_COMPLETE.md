**Before**: Basic validation for ~12 fields
**After**: Comprehensive validation for 35+ fields

### Enhanced Store Method:
- Complete field validation for all database columns
- Proper enum validation for category, type, priority, status, funding_source
- Budget relationship validation (allocated ≤ total, utilized ≤ allocated)
- Date validation (end_date > start_date, actual dates consistency)
- Array validation for target_puroks, attachments, lessons_learned
- Automatic calculation of remaining_budget
- Default value assignment for required fields

### Enhanced Update Method:
- All validation rules applied to updates
- Smart budget recalculation on field changes
- Comprehensive relationship loading
- Enhanced error handling

### Field Mapping Coverage:
✅ **Basic Information**: title, description, objectives, expected_outcomes
✅ **Classification**: category, type, priority, status
✅ **Timeline**: start_date, end_date, actual_start_date, actual_end_date
✅ **Budget**: total_budget, allocated_budget, utilized_budget, remaining_budget, funding_source, funding_agency
✅ **Location**: location, target_puroks, target_beneficiaries, actual_beneficiaries, beneficiary_criteria
✅ **Management**: project_manager_id, approving_official_id, approved_date, progress_percentage
✅ **Documentation**: attachments, remarks, completion_report, lessons_learned
✅ **Monitoring**: last_monitoring_date, monitoring_remarks, quality_rating, evaluation_notes
✅ **Metadata**: created_by, updated_by (auto-assigned)

## Database Schema Alignment

### Project Model (Project.php)
- ✅ All 43 fillable fields properly mapped
- ✅ Comprehensive casting for dates, decimals, integers, arrays
- ✅ Relationship definitions (projectManager, approvingOfficial, milestones, teamMembers)
- ✅ Computed attributes (budget_utilization_rate, days_remaining, is_overdue)

### Migration Support
- ✅ Complete database schema with all field types
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ Enum validation at database level
- ✅ Index optimization for performance

## Validation & Error Handling

### Frontend Validation:
- Required field validation
- Date range validation (end > start)
- Budget validation (allocated ≤ total)
- Location validation
- Real-time error clearing on user input

### Backend Validation:
- Comprehensive Laravel validation rules
- Field-specific error messages
- Relationship validation (foreign keys)
- Business logic validation (budget constraints)
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Security & Data Integrity

### Double-Click Protection:
- `isSubmitting` state prevents multiple submissions
- Button disabled during submission
- Form state locked during processing

### Input Sanitization:
- XSS protection through React input handling
- Laravel validation and sanitization
- Proper type casting and validation

### Data Consistency:
- Budget calculations ensure consistency
- Date validation prevents invalid ranges
- Foreign key constraints maintain relationships
