# CODEBASE SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETE

## âœ… SYNCHRONIZATION SUMMARY

The `ResidentController` has been established as the **source of truth** for all resident data validation and the entire codebase has been synchronized accordingly.

## ðŸ”„ CHANGES MADE

### 1. **Controller Validation Rules** (Source of Truth)
- âœ… `store()` method: Complete validation rules with organized field groups
- âœ… `update()` method: Synchronized with store() method validation
- âœ… Fixed `Auth::id()` usage for proper authentication

**Field Groups:**
- **Basic Information**: first_name, last_name, middle_name, suffix, birth_date, birth_place, gender, civil_status, nationality, religion, employment_status, educational_attainment
- **Contact Information**: mobile_number, landline_number, email_address, house_number, street, purok, complete_address
- **Family Information**: household_id, is_household_head, relationship_to_head, mother_name, father_name, emergency_contact_name, emergency_contact_number, emergency_contact_relationship
- **Government IDs and Documents**: primary_id_type, id_number, philhealth_number, sss_number, tin_number, voters_id_number
- **Health & Classifications**: medical_conditions, allergies, senior_citizen, person_with_disability, disability_type, indigenous_people, indigenous_group, four_ps_beneficiary, four_ps_household_id

### 2. **Resident Model Updates**
- âœ… Updated `$fillable` array to match controller validation exactly
- âœ… Organized fillable fields by the same groups as controller
- âœ… Removed fields not present in controller validation (age, barangay, municipality, province, zip_code, occupation, employer, monthly_income, voter_status, precinct_number)
- âœ… Updated `$casts` to remove unused fields

### 3. **Database Schema Synchronization**
- âœ… Created migration to rename `telephone_number` â†’ `landline_number`
- âœ… Verified all controller validation fields exist in database
- âœ… Previous migration already added missing fields (mother_name, father_name, primary_id_type, id_number)

### 4. **Code Quality Fixes**
- âœ… Added missing `Auth` facade import
- âœ… Fixed `auth()->id()` calls to use `Auth::id()`
- âœ… Eliminated all compilation errors

## ðŸŽ¯ VALIDATION

The codebase is now fully synchronized:

1. **Controller** â†’ Defines what fields are required/optional
2. **Model** â†’ Only allows fields that are in controller validation
3. **Database** â†’ Has columns for all controller validation fields
4. **Field Names** â†’ Consistent across all layers (landline_number)

## ðŸš€ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

Going forward, any schema changes should follow this pattern:

1. **Update Controller Validation** (source of truth)
2. **Update Model $fillable** array to match
3. **Create Migration** for database schema changes
4. **Test API endpoints** to ensure everything works

## âœ… VERIFICATION

- âœ… All routes accessible (`php artisan route:list`)
- âœ… No compilation errors in controller or model
- âœ… Migration completed successfully
- âœ… Field naming consistent throughout codebase

The `ResidentController` is now the authoritative source for all resident data structure decisions.
